This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instagram Feed Search

Instagram Feed Search will allow users to search through their Instagram feed by date, people tagged, and location. More options to be implemented later. I got inspiration to create this when I realized I have to scroll through my 700+ Instagram posts everytime I want to find an old photo.

This project is still a work in progress. It is not available for other users yet as I am testing it with my own Instagram account first. Currently, I am able to retrieve some of my Instagram posts by date!
