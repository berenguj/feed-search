This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instagram Feed Search

Instagram Feed Search allows users to search through their Instagram feed by date, people tagged, and location. More options to be implemented later. I got inspiration to create this when I realized I have to scroll through my 700+ Instagram posts everytime I want to find an old photo.
